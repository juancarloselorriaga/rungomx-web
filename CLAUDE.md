## Package Management

`pnpm`

## Documentation

Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.

## NextJS

**When starting work on a Next.js project, ALWAYS call the `init` tool from
next-devtools-mcp FIRST to set up proper context and establish documentation
requirements. Do this automatically without being asked.**
